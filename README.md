Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make notkeychron/q6:default

Flashing example for this keyboard:

    make notkeychron/q6:default:flash

## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader in 3 ways:

* **Bootmagic reset**: Hold down the key at (0,0) in the matrix (usually the top left key or Escape) and plug in the keyboard
* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button underneath the Space Bar
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` *(or `RESET`)* if it is available

## Why?

Basically, I wanted to compile from `qmk/qmk_firmware:master` but that code caused me strife.  So I wrote my own, different in the following ways:

* Initially I ported the code to make use of the IÂ²C EEPROM slot on the Q1 PCB. *(This code is still there, but now requires the `EEPROM=1` make command argument added.)*
* The code consolidates all the different variants in `keychron/qmk_firmware:playground` into one common source code base. *(I'm a huge proponent of refactoring.)*
* With a recent PR into `qmk/qmk_firmware:develop` QMK admins added a EFL/EL driver that now allows the STM32 flash to run as an emulated EEPROM.  This code is now incorporated and is the default compile.

Use this code to learn from - but it's not endorsed by either Keychron or QMK.

## How To

Please read the [HOW2COMPILE.md](HOW2COMPILE.md) file for instructions on how to use this code.
